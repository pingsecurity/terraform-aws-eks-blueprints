# Argo EVENTS

## Introduction

What is Argo Events?
Argo Events is an event-driven workflow automation framework for Kubernetes. It allows you to trigger 10 different actions (such as the creation of Kubernetes objects, invoke workflows or serverless workloads) on over 20 different events (such as webhook, S3 drop, cron schedule, messaging queues - e.g. Kafka, GCP PubSub, SNS, SQS).
